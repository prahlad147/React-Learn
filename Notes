Create React App

-> To learn and test React, you should set up a React Environment on your computer.
-> The create-react-app tool is an officially supported way to create React applications.
-> Node.js is required to use create-react-app.
-> Open your terminal in the directory you would like to create your application.
-> Run this command to create a React application named my-react-app:


-> npx create-react-app my-react-app 

create-react-app will set up everything you need to run a React application.
Note: If you've previously installed create-react-app globally, 
-> it is recommended that you uninstall the package to ensure npx always uses the latest version of create-react-app. 
-> To uninstall, run this command: npm uninstall -g create-react-app.
