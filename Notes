-> React is a JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
-> React is used to build single-page applications.
-> React allows us to create reusable UI components.
-> React, sometimes referred to as a frontend JavaScript framework, is a JavaScript library created by Facebook.



Example:

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function Hello(props) {
  return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById("root"));
root.render(<Hello />);



Output:
Hello World!



Exercise:

Enter the correct ReactDOM method to render the React element to the DOM.

ReactDOM._______(myElement, document.getElementById('root'));

Ans : render




Create React App:

-> The create-react-app tool is an officially supported way to create React applications.
-> Node.js is required to use create-react-app.


-> Open your terminal in the directory you would like to create your application.

-> Run this command to create a React application named my-react-app:
npx create-react-app my-react-app

-> create-react-app will set up everything you need to run a React application.

Note: If you've previously installed create-react-app globally, 
  it is recommended that you uninstall the package to ensure npx always uses the latest version of create-react-app. 
  
-> To uninstall, run this command: 
      npm uninstall -g create-react-app.




Run the React Application:

Run this command to move to the my-react-app directory:
cd my-react-app

Run this command to execute the React application my-react-app:
npm start

-> A new browser window will pop up with your newly created React App! 
-> If not, open your browser and type localhost:3000 in the address bar.




What is a localhost 3000?

-> Localhost:3000 is the URL adress at which your web app (during development) is accessible if you started it (with a command in the console, 
    like for example: npm start). 
-> Localhost means that it's your computer that is hosting the app, and it doesn't mean that it's accessible on other computers.




How does React Work?

-> React creates a VIRTUAL DOM in memory.
-> Instead of manipulating the browser's DOM directly, React creates a virtual DOM in memory, 
    where it does all the necessary manipulating, before making the changes in the browser DOM.
-> React only changes what needs to be changed!
-> React finds out what changes have been made, and changes only what needs to be changed. 


-> Start by including three scripts, the first two let us write React code in our JavaScripts, and the third, Babel, 
    allows us to write JSX syntax and ES6 in older browsers.



Example:

Include three CDN's in your HTML file:

<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react@18/umd/react.development.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/react-dom@18/umd/react-dom.development.js" crossorigin></script>
    <script src="https://unpkg.com/@babel/standalone/babel.min.js"></script>
  </head>
  <body>

    <div id="mydiv"></div>

    <script type="text/babel">
      function Hello() {
        return <h1>Hello World!</h1>;
      }

      ReactDOM.render(<Hello />, document.getElementById('mydiv'))
    </script>

  </body>
</html>




Modify the React Application:

So far so good, but how do I change the content?

-> Look in the my-react-app directory, and you will find a src folder. 
-> Inside the src folder there is a file called App.js, open it and it will look like this:

/myReactApp/src/App.js:

import logo from './logo.svg';
import './App.css';

function App() {
  return (
    <div className="App">
      <header className="App-header">
        <img src={logo} className="App-logo" alt="logo" />
        <p>
          Edit <code>src/App.js</code> and save to reload.
        </p>
        <a className="App-link" href="https://reactjs.org" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">
          Learn React
        </a>
      </header>
    </div>
  );
}

export default App;


Try changing the HTML content and save the file.

-> Notice that the changes are visible immediately after you save the file, you do not have to reload the browser!




-> If you want to follow the same steps on your computer, start by stripping down the src folder to only contain one file: index.js. 
-> You should also remove any unnecessary lines of code inside the index.js file to make them look like the example in the "Show React" tool below:


Example

Click the "Run Example" button to see the result.

index.js:

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

const myFirstElement = <h1>Hello React!</h1>

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(myFirstElement);




What is ES6?

-> ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6.
-> ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript, it was published in 2015, and is also known as ECMAScript 2015.


Why Should I Learn ES6?

-> React uses ES6, and you should be familiar with some of the new features like:

    Classes
    Arrow Functions
    Variables (let, const, var)
    Array Methods like .map()
    Destructuring
    Modules
    Ternary Operator
    Spread Operator





React ES6 Classes:


Classes

-> ES6 introduced classes.
-> A class is a type of function, but instead of using the keyword function to initiate it, we use the keyword class, 
        and the properties are assigned inside a constructor() method.


Example:

A simple class constructor:

class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.brand = name;
  }
}


-> Notice the case of the class name. 
-> We have begun the name, "Car", with an uppercase character. 
-> This is a standard naming convention for classes.




Now you can create objects using the Car class:


Example:

Create an object called "mycar" based on the Car class:

class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.brand = name;
  }
}

const mycar = new Car("Ford");


 
 
Method in Classes:

You can add your own methods in a class:


Example

Create a method named "present":

class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.brand = name;
  }
  
  present() {
    return 'I have a ' + this.brand;
  }
}

const mycar = new Car("Ford");
mycar.present();





Class Inheritance:

-> To create a class inheritance, use the extends keyword.
-> A class created with a class inheritance inherits all the methods from another class:


Example:

Create a class named "Model" which will inherit the methods from the "Car" class:

class Car {
  constructor(name) {
    this.brand = name;
  }

  present() {
    return 'I have a ' + this.brand;
  }
}

class Model extends Car {
  constructor(name, mod) {
    super(name);
    this.model = mod;
  }  
  show() {
      return this.present() + ', it is a ' + this.model
  }
}
const mycar = new Model("Ford", "Mustang");
mycar.show();




-> The super() method refers to the parent class.
-> By calling the super() method in the constructor method, we call the parent's constructor method and gets access to the parent's properties and methods.




React ES6 Arrow Functions:

Arrow Functions:

Arrow functions allow us to write shorter function syntax:


Before:

hello = function() {
  return "Hello World!";
}



With Arrow Function:

hello = () => {
  return "Hello World!";
}



-> It gets shorter! If the function has only one statement, and the statement returns a value, you can remove the brackets and the return keyword:


Arrow Functions Return Value by Default:

hello = () => "Hello World!";



Notes: 
-> This works only if the function has only one statement.

-> If you have parameters, you pass them inside the parentheses:

Arrow Function With Parameters:

hello = (val) => "Hello " + val;





In fact, if you have only one parameter, you can skip the parentheses as well:

Arrow Function Without Parentheses:

hello = val => "Hello " + val;


What About this?

-> The handling of this is also different in arrow functions compared to regular functions.
-> In short, with arrow functions there is no binding of this.
-> In regular functions the this keyword represented the object that called the function, which could be the window, the document, a button or whatever.

-> With arrow functions, the this keyword always represents the object that defined the arrow function.


Let us take a look at two examples to understand the difference.

-> Both examples call a method twice, first when the page loads, and once again when the user clicks a button.
-> The first example uses a regular function, and the second example uses an arrow function.
-> The result shows that the first example returns two different objects (window and button), and the second example returns the Header object twice.




Example:

With a regular function, this represents the object that called the function:

class Header {
  constructor() {
    this.color = "Red";
  }

//Regular function:
  changeColor = function() {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += this;
  }
}

const myheader = new Header();

//The window object calls the function:
window.addEventListener("load", myheader.changeColor);

//A button object calls the function:
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", myheader.changeColor);



Example:

With an arrow function, this represents the Header object no matter who called the function:

class Header {
  constructor() {
    this.color = "Red";
  }

//Arrow function:
  changeColor = () => {
    document.getElementById("demo").innerHTML += this;
  }
}

const myheader = new Header();


//The window object calls the function:
window.addEventListener("load", myheader.changeColor);

//A button object calls the function:
document.getElementById("btn").addEventListener("click", myheader.changeColor);




React ES6 Variables:

Variables:

-> Before ES6 there was only one way of defining your variables: with the var keyword. 
-> If you did not define them, they would be assigned to the global object. 
-> Unless you were in strict mode, then you would get an error if your variables were undefined.


Now, with ES6, there are three ways of defining your variables: var, let, and const.

1. var

var x = 5.6;


-> If you use var outside of a function, it belongs to the global scope.
-> If you use var inside of a function, it belongs to that function.
-> If you use var inside of a block, i.e. a for loop, the variable is still available outside of that block.

Notes:
-> var has a function scope, not a block scope.




2. let

let x = 5.6;


-> let is the block scoped version of var, and is limited to the block (or expression) where it is defined.
-> If you use let inside of a block, i.e. a for loop, the variable is only available inside of that loop.


Notes:
-> let has a block scope.





3. const

const x = 5.6;


Notes:
-> const is a variable that once it has been created, its value can never change.
-> const has a block scope.
-> The keyword const is a bit misleading.
-> It does not define a constant value. 
-> It defines a constant reference to a value.



Because of this you can NOT:

    Reassign a constant value
    Reassign a constant array
    Reassign a constant object

    But you CAN:
    Change the elements of constant array
    Change the properties of constant object





React ES6 Array Methods:


Array Methods:
-> There are many JavaScript array methods.
-> One of the most useful in React is the .map() array method.
-> The .map() method allows you to run a function on each item in the array, returning a new array as the result.
-> In React, map() can be used to generate lists.



Example,

Generate a list of items from an array:

const myArray = ['apple', 'banana', 'orange'];

const myList = myArray.map((item) => <p>{item}</p>)




React ES6 Destructuring:


Destructuring

-> To illustrate destructuring, we'll make a sandwich. 
-> Do you take everything out of the refrigerator to make your sandwich? 
-> No, you only take out the items you would like to use on your sandwich.


-> Destructuring is exactly the same. 
-> We may have an array or object that we are working with, but we only need some of the items contained in these.
-> Destructuring makes it easy to extract only what is needed.





Destructing Arrays:

-> Here is the old way of assigning array items to a variable:

Before:

const vehicles = ['mustang', 'f-150', 'expedition'];

// old way
const car = vehicles[0];
const truck = vehicles[1];
const suv = vehicles[2];



After:

-> Here is the new way of assigning array items to a variable:

With destructuring:

const vehicles = ['mustang', 'f-150', 'expedition'];

const [car, truck, suv] = vehicles;



-> When destructuring arrays, the order that variables are declared is important.
-> If we only want the car and suv we can simply leave out the truck but keep the comma:

const vehicles = ['mustang', 'f-150', 'expedition'];

const [car,, suv] = vehicles;


Destructuring comes in handy when a function returns an array:

Example:

function calculate(a, b) {
  const add = a + b;
  const subtract = a - b;
  const multiply = a * b;
  const divide = a / b;

  return [add, subtract, multiply, divide];
}

const [add, subtract, multiply, divide] = calculate(4, 7);



Destructuring Objects:

Here is the old way of using an object inside a function:
Before:

const vehicleOne = {
  brand: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
  type: 'car',
  year: 2021, 
  color: 'red'
}

myVehicle(vehicleOne);

// old way
function myVehicle(vehicle) {
  const message = 'My ' + vehicle.type + ' is a ' + vehicle.color + ' ' + vehicle.brand + ' ' + vehicle.model + '.';
}





Here is the new way of using an object inside a function:

With destructuring:

const vehicleOne = {
  brand: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
  type: 'car',
  year: 2021, 
  color: 'red'
}

myVehicle(vehicleOne);

function myVehicle({type, color, brand, model}) {
  const message = 'My ' + type + ' is a ' + color + ' ' + brand + ' ' + model + '.';
}




Notice that the object properties do not have to be declared in a specific order.

We can even destructure deeply nested objects by referencing the nested object then using a colon and 
    curly braces to again destructure the items needed from the nested object:
    
    
Example

const vehicleOne = {
  brand: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
  type: 'car',
  year: 2021, 
  color: 'red',
  registration: {
    city: 'Houston',
    state: 'Texas',
    country: 'USA'
  }
}

myVehicle(vehicleOne)

function myVehicle({ model, registration: { state } }) {
  const message = 'My ' + model + ' is registered in ' + state + '.';
}




React ES6 Spread Operator:


Spread Operator:

The JavaScript spread operator (...) allows us to quickly copy all or part of an existing array or object into another array or object.
Example

const numbersOne = [1, 2, 3];
const numbersTwo = [4, 5, 6];
const numbersCombined = [...numbersOne, ...numbersTwo];



The spread operator is often used in combination with destructuring.
Example

Assign the first and second items from numbers to variables and put the rest in an array:

const numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6];

const [one, two, ...rest] = numbers;




We can use the spread operator with objects too:
Example

Combine these two objects:

const myVehicle = {
  brand: 'Ford',
  model: 'Mustang',
  color: 'red'
}

const updateMyVehicle = {
  type: 'car',
  year: 2021, 
  color: 'yellow'
}

const myUpdatedVehicle = {...myVehicle, ...updateMyVehicle}


Notice the properties that did not match were combined, but the property that did match, color, was overwritten by the last object that was passed, updateMyVehicle. 
The resulting color is now yellow.




React ES6 Modules:


Modules

-> JavaScript modules allow you to break up your code into separate files.
-> This makes it easier to maintain the code-base.
-> ES Modules rely on the import and export statements.


Export

-> You can export a function or variable from any file.
-> Let us create a file named person.js, and fill it with the things we want to export.
-> There are two types of exports: Named and Default.




Named Exports:

-> You can create named exports two ways. 
-> In-line individually, or all at once at the bottom.


In-line individually:

person.js

export const name = "Jesse"
export const age = 40



-> All at once at the bottom:

person.js

const name = "Jesse"
const age = 40

export { name, age }




Default Exports:

Let us create another file, named message.js, and use it for demonstrating default export.

You can only have one default export in a file.
Example

message.js

const message = () => {
  const name = "Jesse";
  const age = 40;
  return name + ' is ' + age + 'years old.';
};

export default message;




Import:

-> You can import modules into a file in two ways, based on if they are named exports or default exports.
-> Named exports must be destructured using curly braces. 
-> Default exports do not.


Import from named exports:

Import named exports from the file person.js:

import { name, age } from "./person.js";




Import from default exports:

Import a default export from the file message.js:

import message from "./message.js";




React ES6 Ternary Operator:


Ternary Operator:
-> The ternary operator is a simplified conditional operator like if / else.

Syntax: condition ? <expression if true> : <expression if false>

Here is an example using if / else:


Before:

if (authenticated) {
  renderApp();
} else {
  renderLogin();
}

Here is the same example using a ternary operator:
With Ternary

authenticated ? renderApp() : renderLogin();





React Render HTML:

-> React's goal is in many ways to render HTML in a web page.
-> React renders HTML to the web page by using a function called ReactDOM.render().


The Render Function

-> The ReactDOM.render() function takes two arguments, HTML code and an HTML element.
-> The purpose of the function is to display the specified HTML code inside the specified HTML element.



But render where?
-> There is another folder in the root directory of your React project, named "public". 
-> In this folder, there is an index.html file.


You'll notice a single <div> in the body of this file. This is where our React application will be rendered.


Example

Display a paragraph inside an element with the id of "root":

ReactDOM.render(<p>Hello</p>, document.getElementById('root'));

The result is displayed in the <div id="root"> element:

<body>
  <div id="root"></div>
</body>




The HTML Code:

-> The HTML code in this tutorial uses JSX which allows you to write HTML tags inside the JavaScript code:
-> Do not worry if the syntax is unfamiliar.


Example

Create a variable that contains HTML code and display it in the "root" node:

const myelement = (
  <table>
    <tr>
      <th>Name</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>John</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
      <td>Elsa</td>
    </tr>
  </table>
);

ReactDOM.render(myelement, document.getElementById('root'));





The Root Node:

-> The root node is the HTML element where you want to display the result.
-> It is like a container for content managed by React.
-> It does NOT have to be a <div> element and it does NOT have to have the id='root':



Example:

The root node can be called whatever you like:

<body>

  <header id="sandy"></header>

</body>

Display the result in the <header id="sandy"> element:

ReactDOM.render(<p>Hallo</p>, document.getElementById('sandy'));




What is JSX?

-> JSX stands for JavaScript XML.
-> JSX allows us to write HTML in React.
-> JSX makes it easier to write and add HTML in React.




Coding JSX:

-> JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement() and/or appendChild() methods.
-> JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.
-> You are not required to use JSX, but JSX makes it easier to write React applications.




Here are two examples. 

The first uses JSX and the second does not:



Example 1

JSX:

const myElement = <h1>I Love JSX!</h1>;

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(myElement);



Example 2

Without JSX:

const myElement = React.createElement('h1', {}, 'I do not use JSX!');

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(myElement);



-> As you can see in the first example, JSX allows us to write HTML directly within the JavaScript code.
-> JSX is an extension of the JavaScript language based on ES6, and is translated into regular JavaScript at runtime.



Expressions in JSX

-> With JSX you can write expressions inside curly braces { }.
-> The expression can be a React variable, or property, or any other valid JavaScript expression. 



-> JSX will execute the expression and return the result:

Example

Execute the expression 5 + 5:

const myElement = <h1>React is {5 + 5} times better with JSX</h1>;




Inserting a Large Block of HTML:

To write HTML on multiple lines, put the HTML inside parentheses:


Example

Create a list with three list items:

const myElement = (
  <ul>
    <li>Apples</li>
    <li>Bananas</li>
    <li>Cherries</li>
  </ul>
);





One Top Level Element:

-> The HTML code must be wrapped in ONE top level element.
-> So if you like to write two paragraphs, you must put them inside a parent element, like a div element.



Example:

Wrap two paragraphs inside one DIV element:

const myElement = (
  <div>
    <p>I am a paragraph.</p>
    <p>I am a paragraph too.</p>
  </div>
);



Notes:
-> JSX will throw an error if the HTML is not correct, or if the HTML misses a parent element.
-> Alternatively, you can use a "fragment" to wrap multiple lines. 
-> This will prevent unnecessarily adding extra nodes to the DOM.
-> A fragment looks like an empty HTML tag: <></>.


Example:

Wrap two paragraphs inside a fragment:

const myElement = (
  <>
    <p>I am a paragraph.</p>
    <p>I am a paragraph too.</p>
  </>
);




Elements Must be Closed:
-> JSX follows XML rules, and therefore HTML elements must be properly closed.


Example

Close empty elements with />

const myElement = <input type="text" />;

-> JSX will throw an error if the HTML is not properly closed.




Attribute class = className?

-> The class attribute is a much used attribute in HTML, but since JSX is rendered as JavaScript, 
      and the class keyword is a reserved word in JavaScript, you are not allowed to use it in JSX.

-> Use attribute className instead.
-> JSX solved this by using className instead. 
-> When JSX is rendered, it translates className attributes into class attributes.



Example:

Use attribute className instead of class in JSX:

const myElement = <h1 className="myclass">Hello World</h1>;





Conditions - if statements:


-> React supports if statements, but not inside JSX.
-> To be able to use conditional statements in JSX, you should put the if statements outside of the JSX, or you could use a ternary expression instead:


Option 1:

Write if statements outside of the JSX code:


Example

Write "Hello" if x is less than 10, otherwise "Goodbye":

const x = 5;
let text = "Goodbye";
if (x < 10) {
  text = "Hello";
}

const myElement = <h1>{text}</h1>;




Option 2:

Use ternary expressions instead:


Example

Write "Hello" if x is less than 10, otherwise "Goodbye":

const x = 5;

const myElement = <h1>{(x) < 10 ? "Hello" : "Goodbye"}</h1>;




Note:

-> that in order to embed a JavaScript expression inside JSX, the JavaScript must be wrapped with curly braces, {}.




React Components:

-> Components are like functions that return HTML elements.


React Components:

-> Components are independent and reusable bits of code. 
-> They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML.
-> Components come in two types, Class components and Function components, we will concentrate on Function components.
-> In older React code bases, you may find Class components primarily used. 
-> It is now suggested to use Function components along with Hooks, which were added in React 16.8. 
-> There is an optional section on Class components for your reference.




Create Your First Component:

-> When creating a React component, the component's name MUST start with an upper case letter.


Class Component:

-> A class component must include the extends React.Component statement. 
-> This statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.
-> The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.



Example:

Create a Class component called Car

class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}




Function Component:

-> A Function component also returns HTML, and behaves much the same way as a Class component, 
      but Function components can be written using much less code, are easier to understand, and will be preferred.
      

Example:

Create a Function component called Car

function Car() {
  return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
}




Rendering a Component:

-> Now your React application has a component called Car, which returns an <h2> element.
-> To use this component in your application, use similar syntax as normal HTML: <Car />


Example:

Display the Car component in the "root" element:

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Car />);




Props:

-> Components can be passed as props, which stands for properties.
-> Props are like function arguments, and you send them into the component as attributes.



Example:

Use an attribute to pass a color to the Car component, and use it in the render() function:

function Car(props) {
  return <h2>I am a {props.color} Car!</h2>;
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Car color="red"/>);




Components in Components:

-> We can refer to components inside other components.


Example

Use the Car component inside the Garage component:

function Car() {
  return <h2>I am a Car!</h2>;
}

function Garage() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Who lives in my Garage?</h1>
      <Car />
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Garage />);





Components in Files:

-> React is all about re-using code, and it is recommended to split your components into separate files.
-> To do that, create a new file with a .js file extension and put the code inside it:

Note that the filename must start with an uppercase character.


Example

This is the new file, we named it "Car.js":

function Car() {
  return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
}

export default Car;


-> To be able to use the Car component, you have to import the file in your application.


Example

Now we import the "Car.js" file in the application, and we can use the Car component as if it was created here.

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import Car from './Car.js';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Car />);




React Class Components:


React Components:
-> Components are independent and reusable bits of code. 
-> They serve the same purpose as JavaScript functions, but work in isolation and return HTML via a render() function.




Create a Class Component:

-> When creating a React component, the component's name must start with an upper case letter.
-> The component has to include the extends React.Component statement, this statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, 
      and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.
-> The component also requires a render() method, this method returns HTML.



Example:

Create a Class component called Car

class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}


-> Now your React application has a component called Car, which returns a <h2> element.
-> To use this component in your application, use similar syntax as normal HTML: <Car />



Example:

Display the Car component in the "root" element:

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Car />);




Component Constructor:

-> If there is a constructor() function in your component, this function will be called when the component gets initiated.
-> The constructor function is where you initiate the component's properties.
-> In React, component properties should be kept in an object called state.
-> The constructor function is also where you honor the inheritance of the parent component by including the super() statement,
      which executes the parent component's constructor function, and your component has access to all the functions of the parent component (React.Component).



Example:

Create a constructor function in the Car component, and add a color property:

class Car extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {color: "red"};
  }
  render() {
    return <h2>I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}




Use the color property in the render() function:


Example:

class Car extends React.Component {
  constructor() {
    super();
    this.state = {color: "red"};
  }
  render() {
    return <h2>I am a {this.state.color} Car!</h2>;
  }
}






Props:

-> Another way of handling component properties is by using props.
-> Props are like function arguments, and you send them into the component as attributes.

Example:

Use an attribute to pass a color to the Car component, and use it in the render() function:

class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>I am a {this.props.color} Car!</h2>;
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Car color="red"/>);




Props in the Constructor:

-> If your component has a constructor function, the props should always be passed to the constructor and also to the React.Component via the super() method.


Example:

class Car extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  }
  render() {
    return <h2>I am a {this.props.model}!</h2>;
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Car model="Mustang"/>);




Components in Components;

We can refer to components inside other components:


Example:

Use the Car component inside the Garage component:

class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}

class Garage extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
      <h1>Who lives in my Garage?</h1>
      <Car />
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Garage />);




Components in Files:

-> React is all about re-using code, and it can be smart to insert some of your components in separate files.
-> To do that, create a new file with a .js file extension and put the code inside it:

Note that the file must start by importing React (as before), and it has to end with the statement export default Car;.


Example:

This is the new file, we named it Car.js:

import React from 'react';

class Car extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return <h2>Hi, I am a Car!</h2>;
  }
}

export default Car;



Example:

Now we import the Car.js file in the application, and we can use the Car component as if it was created here.

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import Car from './Car.js';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Car />);




Creating the state Object:

The state object is initialized in the constructor:


Example:

Specify the state object in the constructor method:

class Car extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
  this.state = {brand: "Ford"};
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>My Car</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}





-> The state object can contain as many properties as you like:

Example
-> Specify all the properties your component need:

class Car extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      brand: "Ford",
      model: "Mustang",
      color: "red",
      year: 1964
    };
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>My Car</h1>
      </div>
    );
  }
}



Using the state Object:

-> Refer to the state object anywhere in the component by using the this.state.propertyname syntax:



Example:

Refer to the state object in the render() method:

class Car extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      brand: "Ford",
      model: "Mustang",
      color: "red",
      year: 1964
    };
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>My {this.state.brand}</h1>
        <p>
          It is a {this.state.color}
          {this.state.model}
          from {this.state.year}.
        </p>
      </div>
    );
  }
}





Changing the state Object:

-> To change a value in the state object, use the this.setState() method.
-> When a value in the state object changes, the component will re-render, meaning that the output will change according to the new value(s).



Example:

Add a button with an onClick event that will change the color property:

class Car extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {
      brand: "Ford",
      model: "Mustang",
      color: "red",
      year: 1964
    };
  }
  changeColor = () => {
    this.setState({color: "blue"});
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>My {this.state.brand}</h1>
        <p>
          It is a {this.state.color}
          {this.state.model}
          from {this.state.year}.
        </p>
        <button
          type="button"
          onClick={this.changeColor}
        >Change color</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}



-> Always use the setState() method to change the state object, it will ensure that the component knows its been updated and calls the render() method 
      (and all the other lifecycle methods).




Lifecycle of Components:

-> Each component in React has a lifecycle which you can monitor and manipulate during its three main phases.
-> The three phases are: Mounting, Updating, and Unmounting.



Mounting:

-> Mounting means putting elements into the DOM.

-> React has four built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when mounting a component:

    constructor()
    getDerivedStateFromProps()
    render()
    componentDidMount()

-> The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.




constructor:L

-> The constructor() method is called before anything else, when the component is initiated, 
            and it is the natural place to set up the initial state and other initial values.

-> The constructor() method is called with the props, as arguments, and you should always start by calling the super(props) before anything else, 
          this will initiate the parent's constructor method and allows the component to inherit methods from its parent (React.Component).


Example:

-> The constructor method is called, by React, every time you make a component:

class Header extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {favoritecolor: "red"};
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>My Favorite Color is {this.state.favoritecolor}</h1>
    );
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Header />);




getDerivedStateFromProps:

-> The getDerivedStateFromProps() method is called right before rendering the element(s) in the DOM.
-> This is the natural place to set the state object based on the initial props.
-> It takes state as an argument, and returns an object with changes to the state.

-> The example below starts with the favorite color being "red", but the getDerivedStateFromProps() method updates the favorite color based on the favcol attribute:


Example:

The getDerivedStateFromProps method is called right before the render method:

class Header extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {favoritecolor: "red"};
  }
  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
    return {favoritecolor: props.favcol };
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>My Favorite Color is {this.state.favoritecolor}</h1>
    );
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Header favcol="yellow"/>);



render:

The render() method is required, and is the method that actually outputs the HTML to the DOM.


Example:

-> A simple component with a simple render() method:

class Header extends React.Component {
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>This is the content of the Header component</h1>
    );
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Header />);





componentDidMount:

-> The componentDidMount() method is called after the component is rendered.
-> This is where you run statements that requires that the component is already placed in the DOM.


Example:

At first my favorite color is red, but give me a second, and it is yellow instead:

class Header extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {favoritecolor: "red"};
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.setState({favoritecolor: "yellow"})
    }, 1000)
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>My Favorite Color is {this.state.favoritecolor}</h1>
    );
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Header />);





Updating:

-> The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is updated.
-> A component is updated whenever there is a change in the component's state or props.

-> React has five built-in methods that gets called, in this order, when a component is updated:

    getDerivedStateFromProps()
    shouldComponentUpdate()
    render()
    getSnapshotBeforeUpdate()
    componentDidUpdate()

-> The render() method is required and will always be called, the others are optional and will be called if you define them.





getDerivedStateFromProps:

-> Also at updates the getDerivedStateFromProps method is called. 
-> This is the first method that is called when a component gets updated.
-> This is still the natural place to set the state object based on the initial props.
-> The example below has a button that changes the favorite color to blue, but since the getDerivedStateFromProps() method is called, 
          which updates the state with the color from the favcol attribute, the favorite color is still rendered as yellow:



Example:

If the component gets updated, the getDerivedStateFromProps() method is called:

class Header extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {favoritecolor: "red"};
  }
  static getDerivedStateFromProps(props, state) {
    return {favoritecolor: props.favcol };
  }
  changeColor = () => {
    this.setState({favoritecolor: "blue"});
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
      <h1>My Favorite Color is {this.state.favoritecolor}</h1>
      <button type="button" onClick={this.changeColor}>Change color</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Header favcol="yellow" />);




shouldComponentUpdate:

-> In the shouldComponentUpdate() method you can return a Boolean value that specifies whether React should continue with the rendering or not.
-> The default value is true.

The example below shows what happens when the shouldComponentUpdate() method returns false:


Example:

Stop the component from rendering at any update:

class Header extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {favoritecolor: "red"};
  }
  shouldComponentUpdate() {
    return false;
  }
  changeColor = () => {
    this.setState({favoritecolor: "blue"});
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
      <h1>My Favorite Color is {this.state.favoritecolor}</h1>
      <button type="button" onClick={this.changeColor}>Change color</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Header />);



Example:

Same example as above, but this time the shouldComponentUpdate() method returns true instead:

class Header extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {favoritecolor: "red"};
  }
  shouldComponentUpdate() {
    return true;
  }
  changeColor = () => {
    this.setState({favoritecolor: "blue"});
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
      <h1>My Favorite Color is {this.state.favoritecolor}</h1>
      <button type="button" onClick={this.changeColor}>Change color</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Header />);



-> render

The render() method is of course called when a component gets updated, it has to re-render the HTML to the DOM, with the new changes.

The example below has a button that changes the favorite color to blue:
Example:

Click the button to make a change in the component's state:

class Header extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {favoritecolor: "red"};
  }
  changeColor = () => {
    this.setState({favoritecolor: "blue"});
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
      <h1>My Favorite Color is {this.state.favoritecolor}</h1>
      <button type="button" onClick={this.changeColor}>Change color</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Header />);



getSnapshotBeforeUpdate:

-> In the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method you have access to the props and state before the update, 
            meaning that even after the update, you can check what the values were before the update.

-> If the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method is present, you should also include the componentDidUpdate() method, otherwise you will get an error.

-> The example below might seem complicated, but all it does is this:

-> When the component is mounting it is rendered with the favorite color "red".
-> When the component has been mounted, a timer changes the state, and after one second, the favorite color becomes "yellow".
-> This action triggers the update phase, and since this component has a getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method, this method is executed, and writes a message to the empty DIV1 element.
-> Then the componentDidUpdate() method is executed and writes a message in the empty DIV2 element:


Example:

Use the getSnapshotBeforeUpdate() method to find out what the state object looked like before the update:

class Header extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {favoritecolor: "red"};
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.setState({favoritecolor: "yellow"})
    }, 1000)
  }
  getSnapshotBeforeUpdate(prevProps, prevState) {
    document.getElementById("div1").innerHTML =
    "Before the update, the favorite was " + prevState.favoritecolor;
  }
  componentDidUpdate() {
    document.getElementById("div2").innerHTML =
    "The updated favorite is " + this.state.favoritecolor;
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
        <h1>My Favorite Color is {this.state.favoritecolor}</h1>
        <div id="div1"></div>
        <div id="div2"></div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Header />);




componentDidUpdate:

-> The componentDidUpdate method is called after the component is updated in the DOM.
-> The example below might seem complicated, but all it does is this:
-> When the component is mounting it is rendered with the favorite color "red".
-> When the component has been mounted, a timer changes the state, and the color becomes "yellow".
-> This action triggers the update phase, and since this component has a componentDidUpdate method, 
        this method is executed and writes a message in the empty DIV element:


Example:

The componentDidUpdate method is called after the update has been rendered in the DOM:

class Header extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {favoritecolor: "red"};
  }
  componentDidMount() {
    setTimeout(() => {
      this.setState({favoritecolor: "yellow"})
    }, 1000)
  }
  componentDidUpdate() {
    document.getElementById("mydiv").innerHTML =
    "The updated favorite is " + this.state.favoritecolor;
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <div>
      <h1>My Favorite Color is {this.state.favoritecolor}</h1>
      <div id="mydiv"></div>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Header />);





Unmounting:

-> The next phase in the lifecycle is when a component is removed from the DOM, or unmounting as React likes to call it.
-> React has only one built-in method that gets called when a component is unmounted:
       componentWillUnmount()



componentWillUnmount:

-> The componentWillUnmount method is called when the component is about to be removed from the DOM.


Example:

Click the button to delete the header:

class Container extends React.Component {
  constructor(props) {
    super(props);
    this.state = {show: true};
  }
  delHeader = () => {
    this.setState({show: false});
  }
  render() {
    let myheader;
    if (this.state.show) {
      myheader = <Child />;
    };
    return (
      <div>
      {myheader}
      <button type="button" onClick={this.delHeader}>Delete Header</button>
      </div>
    );
  }
}

class Child extends React.Component {
  componentWillUnmount() {
    alert("The component named Header is about to be unmounted.");
  }
  render() {
    return (
      <h1>Hello World!</h1>
    );
  }
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Container />);




React Props

-> Props are arguments passed into React components.
-> Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.
-> props stands for properties.


-> React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.

To send props into a component, use the same syntax as HTML attributes:



Example

Add a "brand" attribute to the Car element:

const myElement = <Car brand="Ford" />;


The component receives the argument as a props object:



Example

Use the brand attribute in the component:

function Car(props) {
  return <h2>I am a { props.brand }!</h2>;
}




Pass Data

-> Props are also how you pass data from one component to another, as parameters.


Example

Send the "brand" property from the Garage component to the Car component:

function Car(props) {
  return <h2>I am a { props.brand }!</h2>;
}

function Garage() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Who lives in my garage?</h1>
      <Car brand="Ford" />
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Garage />);




-> If you have a variable to send, and not a string as in the example above, you just put the variable name inside curly brackets:


Example

Create a variable named carName and send it to the Car component:

function Car(props) {
  return <h2>I am a { props.brand }!</h2>;
}

function Garage() {
  const carName = "Ford";
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Who lives in my garage?</h1>
      <Car brand={ carName } />
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Garage />);




Or if it was an object:


Example:

Create an object named carInfo and send it to the Car component:

function Car(props) {
  return <h2>I am a { props.brand.model }!</h2>;
}

function Garage() {
  const carInfo = { name: "Ford", model: "Mustang" };
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Who lives in my garage?</h1>
      <Car brand={ carInfo } />
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Garage />);


Note: React Props are read-only! You will get an error if you try to change their value.






React Events:

-> Just like HTML DOM events, React can perform actions based on user events.
-> React has the same events as HTML: click, change, mouseover etc.



Adding Events;

-> React events are written in camelCase syntax:
-> onClick instead of onclick.


React event handlers are written inside curly braces:

onClick={shoot}  instead of onClick="shoot()".


React:

<button onClick={shoot}>Take the Shot!</button>

HTML:

<button onclick="shoot()">Take the Shot!</button>



Example:

Put the shoot function inside the Football component:

function Football() {
  const shoot = () => {
    alert("Great Shot!");
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={shoot}>Take the shot!</button>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Football />);





Passing Arguments:
-> To pass an argument to an event handler, use an arrow function.


Example:

Send "Goal!" as a parameter to the shoot function, using arrow function:

function Football() {
  const shoot = (a) => {
    alert(a);
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={() => shoot("Goal!")}>Take the shot!</button>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Football />);




React Event Object:

-> Event handlers have access to the React event that triggered the function.
-> In our example the event is the "click" event.


Example:

Arrow Function: Sending the event object manually:

function Football() {
  const shoot = (a, b) => {
    alert(b.type);
    /*
    'b' represents the React event that triggered the function,
    in this case the 'click' event
    */
  }

  return (
    <button onClick={(event) => shoot("Goal!", event)}>Take the shot!</button>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Football />);




React Conditional Rendering:

-> In React, you can conditionally render components.
-> There are several ways to do this.


if Statement

We can use the if JavaScript operator to decide which component to render.
Example:

We'll use these two components:

function MissedGoal() {
  return <h1>MISSED!</h1>;
}

function MadeGoal() {
  return <h1>Goal!</h1>;
}





Example:

Now, we'll create another component that chooses which component to render based on a condition:

function Goal(props) {
  const isGoal = props.isGoal;
  if (isGoal) {
    return <MadeGoal/>;
  }
  return <MissedGoal/>;
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Goal isGoal={false} />);




Try changing the isGoal attribute to true:
Example:

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Goal isGoal={true} />);




Logical && Operator;

-> Another way to conditionally render a React component is by using the && operator.


Example:

We can embed JavaScript expressions in JSX by using curly braces:

function Garage(props) {
  const cars = props.cars;
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Garage</h1>
      {cars.length > 0 &&
        <h2>
          You have {cars.length} cars in your garage.
        </h2>
      }
    </>
  );
}

const cars = ['Ford', 'BMW', 'Audi'];
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Garage cars={cars} />);





If cars.length is equates to true, the expression after && will render.

Try emptying the cars array:

Example:

const cars = [];
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Garage cars={cars} />);



Ternary Operator:

-> Another way to conditionally render elements is by using a ternary operator.

        condition ? true : false

-> We will go back to the goal example.

Example:

Return the MadeGoal component if isGoal is true, otherwise return the MissedGoal component:

function Goal(props) {
  const isGoal = props.isGoal;
  return (
    <>
      { isGoal ? <MadeGoal/> : <MissedGoal/> }
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Goal isGoal={false} />);





React Lists:

-> In React, you will render lists with some type of loop.
-> The JavaScript map() array method is generally the preferred method.
-> If you need a refresher on the map() method, check out the ES6 section.


Example:

Let's render all of the cars from our garage:

function Car(props) {
  return <li>I am a { props.brand }</li>;
}

function Garage() {
  const cars = ['Ford', 'BMW', 'Audi'];
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Who lives in my garage?</h1>
      <ul>
        {cars.map((car) => <Car brand={car} />)}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Garage />);



-> When you run this code in your create-react-app, it will work but you will receive a warning that there is no "key" provided for the list items.




Keys:

-> Keys allow React to keep track of elements. This way, if an item is updated or removed, only that item will be re-rendered instead of the entire list.
-> Keys need to be unique to each sibling. But they can be duplicated globally.
-> Generally, the key should be a unique ID assigned to each item. As a last resort, you can use the array index as a key.


Example:

Let's refactor our previous example to include keys:

function Car(props) {
  return <li>I am a { props.brand }</li>;
}

function Garage() {
  const cars = [
    {id: 1, brand: 'Ford'},
    {id: 2, brand: 'BMW'},
    {id: 3, brand: 'Audi'}
  ];
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Who lives in my garage?</h1>
      <ul>
        {cars.map((car) => <Car key={car.id} brand={car.brand} />)}
      </ul>
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Garage />);





React Forms:

-> Just like in HTML, React uses forms to allow users to interact with the web page.



Adding Forms in React:

You add a form with React like any other element:


Example:

Add a form that allows users to enter their name:

function MyForm() {
  return (
    <form>
      <label>Enter your name:
        <input type="text" />
      </label>
    </form>
  )
}
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<MyForm />);



Notes:
-> This will work as normal, the form will submit and the page will refresh.
-> But this is generally not what we want to happen in React.
-> We want to prevent this default behavior and let React control the form.




Handling Forms:

-> Handling forms is about how you handle the data when it changes value or gets submitted.
-> In HTML, form data is usually handled by the DOM.
-> In React, form data is usually handled by the components.
-> When the data is handled by the components, all the data is stored in the component state.
-> You can control changes by adding event handlers in the onChange attribute.
-> We can use the useState Hook to keep track of each inputs value and provide a "single source of truth" for the entire application






Example:

Use the useState Hook to manage the input:

import { useState } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function MyForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");

  return (
    <form>
      <label>Enter your name:
        <input
          type="text" 
          value={name}
          onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label>
    </form>
  )
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<MyForm />);




Submitting Forms:
-> You can control the submit action by adding an event handler in the onSubmit attribute for the <form>:



Example:

Add a submit button and an event handler in the onSubmit attribute:

import { useState } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function MyForm() {
  const [name, setName] = useState("");

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    alert(`The name you entered was: ${name}`)
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>Enter your name:
        <input 
          type="text" 
          value={name}
          onChange={(e) => setName(e.target.value)}
        />
      </label>
      <input type="submit" />
    </form>
  )
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<MyForm />);





Multiple Input Fields:
-> You can control the values of more than one input field by adding a name attribute to each element.
-> We will initialize our state with an empty object.
-> To access the fields in the event handler use the event.target.name and event.target.value syntax.
-> To update the state, use square brackets [bracket notation] around the property name.



Example:

Write a form with two input fields:

import { useState } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function MyForm() {
  const [inputs, setInputs] = useState({});

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    const name = event.target.name;
    const value = event.target.value;
    setInputs(values => ({...values, [name]: value}))
  }

  const handleSubmit = (event) => {
    event.preventDefault();
    alert(inputs);
  }

  return (
    <form onSubmit={handleSubmit}>
      <label>Enter your name:
      <input 
        type="text" 
        name="username" 
        value={inputs.username || ""} 
        onChange={handleChange}
      />
      </label>
      <label>Enter your age:
        <input 
          type="number" 
          name="age" 
          value={inputs.age || ""} 
          onChange={handleChange}
        />
        </label>
        <input type="submit" />
    </form>
  )
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<MyForm />);


Note: We use the same event handler function for both input fields, we could write one event handler for each, 
          but this gives us much cleaner code and is the preferred way in React.



Textarea:

-> The textarea element in React is slightly different from ordinary HTML.
-> In HTML the value of a textarea was the text between the start tag <textarea> and the end tag </textarea>.

<textarea>
  Content of the textarea.
</textarea>




-> In React the value of a textarea is placed in a value attribute. We'll use the useState Hook to mange the value of the textarea:


Example:

A simple textarea with some content:

import { useState } from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';

function MyForm() {
  const [textarea, setTextarea] = useState(
    "The content of a textarea goes in the value attribute"
  );

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setTextarea(event.target.value)
  }

  return (
    <form>
      <textarea value={textarea} onChange={handleChange} />
    </form>
  )
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<MyForm />);




Select:
-> A drop down list, or a select box, in React is also a bit different from HTML.
-> in HTML, the selected value in the drop down list was defined with the selected attribute:


HTML:

<select>
  <option value="Ford">Ford</option>
  <option value="Volvo" selected>Volvo</option>
  <option value="Fiat">Fiat</option>
</select>



-> In React, the selected value is defined with a value attribute on the select tag:


Example:

A simple select box, where the selected value "Volvo" is initialized in the constructor:

function MyForm() {
  const [myCar, setMyCar] = useState("Volvo");

  const handleChange = (event) => {
    setMyCar(event.target.value)
  }

  return (
    <form>
      <select value={myCar} onChange={handleChange}>
        <option value="Ford">Ford</option>
        <option value="Volvo">Volvo</option>
        <option value="Fiat">Fiat</option>
      </select>
    </form>
  )
}


-> By making these slight changes to <textarea> and <select>, React is able to handle all input elements in the same way.




React Router:

-> Create React App doesn't include page routing.
-> React Router is the most popular solution.


Add React Router:

-> To add React Router in your application, run this in the terminal from the root directory of the application:
    npm i -D react-router-dom

Note: This tutorial uses React Router v6.

-> If you are upgrading from v5, you will need to use the @latest flag:
  npm i -D react-router-dom@latest




Folder Structure:
-> To create an application with multiple page routes, let's first start with the file structure.
-> Within the src folder, we'll create a folder named pages with several files:

src\pages\:

    Layout.js
    Home.js
    Blogs.js
    Contact.js
    NoPage.js

-> Each file will contain a very basic React component.


Basic Usage

-> Now we will use our Router in our index.js file.




Use React Router to route to pages based on URL:

index.js:

import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import { BrowserRouter, Routes, Route } from "react-router-dom";
import Layout from "./pages/Layout";
import Home from "./pages/Home";
import Blogs from "./pages/Blogs";
import Contact from "./pages/Contact";
import NoPage from "./pages/NoPage";

export default function App() {
  return (
    <BrowserRouter>
      <Routes>
        <Route path="/" element={<Layout />}>
          <Route index element={<Home />} />
          <Route path="blogs" element={<Blogs />} />
          <Route path="contact" element={<Contact />} />
          <Route path="*" element={<NoPage />} />
        </Route>
      </Routes>
    </BrowserRouter>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);




Example Explained:

-> We wrap our content first with <BrowserRouter>.
-> Then we define our <Routes>. An application can have multiple <Routes>. Our basic example only uses one.
-> <Route>s can be nested. The first <Route> has a path of / and renders the Layout component.
-> The nested <Route>s inherit and add to the parent route. So the blogs path is combined with the parent and becomes /blogs.
-> The Home component route does not have a path but has an index attribute. That specifies this route as the default route for the parent route, which is /.
-> Setting the path to * will act as a catch-all for any undefined URLs. This is great for a 404 error page




Pages / Components:

-> The Layout component has <Outlet> and <Link> elements.
-> The <Outlet> renders the current route selected.
-> <Link> is used to set the URL and keep track of browsing history.
-> Anytime we link to an internal path, we will use <Link> instead of <a href="">.
-> The "layout route" is a shared component that inserts common content on all pages, such as a navigation menu.



Layout.js:

import { Outlet, Link } from "react-router-dom";

const Layout = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <nav>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <Link to="/">Home</Link>
          </li>
          <li>
            <Link to="/blogs">Blogs</Link>
          </li>
          <li>
            <Link to="/contact">Contact</Link>
          </li>
        </ul>
      </nav>

      <Outlet />
    </>
  )
};

export default Layout;

Home.js:

const Home = () => {
  return <h1>Home</h1>;
};

export default Home;

Blogs.js:

const Blogs = () => {
  return <h1>Blog Articles</h1>;
};

export default Blogs;

Contact.js:

const Contact = () => {
  return <h1>Contact Me</h1>;
};

export default Contact;

NoPage.js:

const NoPage = () => {
  return <h1>404</h1>;
};

export default NoPage;




React Memo:

-> Using memo will cause React to skip rendering a component if its props have not changed.
-> This can improve performance.



Problem:

In this example, the Todos component re-renders even when the todos have not changed.

Example:

index.js:

import { useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import Todos from "./Todos";

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(["todo 1", "todo 2"]);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount((c) => c + 1);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Todos todos={todos} />
      <hr />
      <div>
        Count: {count}
        <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);



Todos.js:

const Todos = ({ todos }) => {
  console.log("child render");
  return (
    <>
      <h2>My Todos</h2>
      {todos.map((todo, index) => {
        return <p key={index}>{todo}</p>;
      })}
    </>
  );
};

export default Todos;


-> When you click the increment button, the Todos component re-renders.
-> If this component was complex, it could cause performance issues.




Solution:
-> To fix this, we can use memo.
-> Use memoto keep the Todos component from needlessly re-rendering.
-> Wrap the Todos component export in memo:


Example:

index.js:

import { useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import Todos from "./Todos";

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState(["todo 1", "todo 2"]);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount((c) => c + 1);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Todos todos={todos} />
      <hr />
      <div>
        Count: {count}
        <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);




Todos.js:

import { memo } from "react";

const Todos = ({ todos }) => {
  console.log("child render");
  return (
    <>
      <h2>My Todos</h2>
      {todos.map((todo, index) => {
        return <p key={index}>{todo}</p>;
      })}
    </>
  );
};

export default memo(Todos);

-> Now the Todos component only re-renders when the todos that are passed to it through props are updated.




Styling React Using CSS:

There are many ways to style React with CSS, this tutorial will take a closer look at three common ways:
-> Inline styling
-> CSS stylesheets
-> CSS Modules




Inline Styling:

To style an element with the inline style attribute, the value must be a JavaScript object:
Example:

Insert an object with the styling information:

const Header = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1 style={{color: "red"}}>Hello Style!</h1>
      <p>Add a little style!</p>
    </>
  );
}

Note: In JSX, JavaScript expressions are written inside curly braces, and since JavaScript objects also use curly braces, the styling in the example above is written inside two sets of curly braces {{}}.



camelCased Property Names:

-> Since the inline CSS is written in a JavaScript object, properties with hyphen separators, like background-color, must be written with camel case syntax:


Example:

Use backgroundColor instead of background-color:

const Header = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1 style={{backgroundColor: "lightblue"}}>Hello Style!</h1>
      <p>Add a little style!</p>
    </>
  );
}




JavaScript Object:

-> You can also create an object with styling information, and refer to it in the style attribute:

Example:

Create a style object named myStyle:

const Header = () => {
  const myStyle = {
    color: "white",
    backgroundColor: "DodgerBlue",
    padding: "10px",
    fontFamily: "Sans-Serif"
  };
  return (
    <>
      <h1 style={myStyle}>Hello Style!</h1>
      <p>Add a little style!</p>
    </>
  );
}




CSS Stylesheet:

You can write your CSS styling in a separate file, just save the file with the .css file extension, and import it in your application.



App.css:

Create a new file called "App.css" and insert some CSS code in it:

body {
  background-color: #282c34;
  color: white;
  padding: 40px;
  font-family: Sans-Serif;
  text-align: center;
}




Note: You can call the file whatever you like, just remember the correct file extension.

Import the stylesheet in your application:
index.js:

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './App.css';

const Header = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello Style!</h1>
      <p>Add a little style!.</p>
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Header />);




CSS Modules:

-> Another way of adding styles to your application is to use CSS Modules.
-> CSS Modules are convenient for components that are placed in separate files.
-> The CSS inside a module is available only for the component that imported it, and you do not have to worry about name conflicts.
-> Create the CSS module with the .module.css extension, example: my-style.module.css.

Create a new file called "my-style.module.css" and insert some CSS code in it:
my-style.module.css:

.bigblue {
  color: DodgerBlue;
  padding: 40px;
  font-family: Sans-Serif;
  text-align: center;
}


Import the stylesheet in your component:
Car.js:

import styles from './my-style.module.css'; 

const Car = () => {
  return <h1 className={styles.bigblue}>Hello Car!</h1>;
}

export default Car;


Import the component in your application:
index.js:

import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import Car from './Car.js';

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Car />);




Styling React Using Sass:


What is Sass?
-> Sass is a CSS pre-processor.
-> Sass files are executed on the server and sends CSS to the browser.


Can I use Sass?
-> If you use the create-react-app in your project, you can easily install and use Sass in your React projects.

Install Sass by running this command in your terminal:
>npm i sass




Create a Sass file:

-> Create a Sass file the same way as you create CSS files, but Sass files have the file extension .scss
-> In Sass files you can use variables and other Sass functions:

my-sass.scss:

Create a variable to define the color of the text:

$myColor: red;

h1 {
  color: $myColor;
}



Import the Sass file the same way as you imported a CSS file:
index.js:

import React from 'react';
import ReactDOM from 'react-dom/client';
import './my-sass.scss';

const Header = () => {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Hello Style!</h1>
      <p>Add a little style!.</p>
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Header />);




React Hooks:

-> Hooks were added to React in version 16.8.
-> Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.
-> Although Hooks generally replace class components, there are no plans to remove classes from React.




What is a Hook?
-> Hooks allow us to "hook" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods.



Example:

Here is an example of a Hook. Don't worry if it doesn't make sense. We will go into more detail in the next section.

import React, { useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function FavoriteColor() {
  const [color, setColor] = useState("red");

  return (
    <>
      <h1>My favorite color is {color}!</h1>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() => setColor("blue")}
      >Blue</button>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() => setColor("red")}
      >Red</button>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() => setColor("pink")}
      >Pink</button>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() => setColor("green")}
      >Green</button>
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<FavoriteColor />);




-> You must import Hooks from react.
-> Here we are using the useState Hook to keep track of the application state.
-> State generally refers to application data or properties that need to be tracked.




Hook Rules:

There are 3 rules for hooks:

    Hooks can only be called inside React function components.
    Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
    Hooks cannot be conditional

Note: Hooks will not work in React class components.



Custom Hooks:

-> If you have stateful logic that needs to be reused in several components, you can build your own custom Hooks.




React useState Hook:

-> The React useState Hook allows us to track state in a function component.
-> State generally refers to data or properties that need to be tracking in an application.


Import useState

To use the useState Hook, we first need to import it into our component.


Example:

At the top of your component, import the useState Hook.

import { useState } from "react";





Initialize useState:
-> We initialize our state by calling useState in our function component.
-> useState accepts an initial state and returns two values:

    1. The current state.
    2. A function that updates the state.

Example:

Initialize state at the top of the function component.

import { useState } from "react";

function FavoriteColor() {
  const [color, setColor] = useState("");
}


-> Notice that again, we are destructuring the returned values from useState.
-> The first value, color, is our current state.
-> The second value, setColor, is the function that is used to update our state.
-> These names are variables that can be named anything you would like.
-> Lastly, we set the initial state to an empty string: useState("")




Read State:
-> We can now include our state anywhere in our component.


Example:

Use the state variable in the rendered component.

import { useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function FavoriteColor() {
  const [color, setColor] = useState("red");

  return <h1>My favorite color is {color}!</h1>
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<FavoriteColor />);




Update State:
-> To update our state, we use our state updater function.
-> We should never directly update state. Ex: color = "red" is not allowed.



Example:

Use a button to update the state:

import { useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function FavoriteColor() {
  const [color, setColor] = useState("red");

  return (
    <>
      <h1>My favorite color is {color}!</h1>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={() => setColor("blue")}
      >Blue</button>
    </>
  )
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<FavoriteColor />);




What Can State Hold:

-> The useState Hook can be used to keep track of strings, numbers, booleans, arrays, objects, and any combination of these!
-> We could create multiple state Hooks to track individual values.


Example:

Create multiple state Hooks:

import { useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function Car() {
  const [brand, setBrand] = useState("Ford");
  const [model, setModel] = useState("Mustang");
  const [year, setYear] = useState("1964");
  const [color, setColor] = useState("red");

  return (
    <>
      <h1>My {brand}</h1>
      <p>
        It is a {color} {model} from {year}.
      </p>
    </>
  )
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Car />);

Or, we can just use one state and include an object instead!


Example:

Create a single Hook that holds an object:

import { useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function Car() {
  const [car, setCar] = useState({
    brand: "Ford",
    model: "Mustang",
    year: "1964",
    color: "red"
  });

  return (
    <>
      <h1>My {car.brand}</h1>
      <p>
        It is a {car.color} {car.model} from {car.year}.
      </p>
    </>
  )
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Car />);

-> Since we are now tracking a single object, we need to reference that object and then the property of that object when rendering the component. (Ex: car.brand)


Updating Objects and Arrays in State

-> When state is updated, the entire state gets overwritten.
-> What if we only want to update the color of our car?
-> If we only called setCar({color: "blue"}), this would remove the brand, model, and year from our state.
-> We can use the JavaScript spread operator to help us.


Example:

Use the JavaScript spread operator to update only the color of the car:

import { useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function Car() {
  const [car, setCar] = useState({
    brand: "Ford",
    model: "Mustang",
    year: "1964",
    color: "red"
  });

  const updateColor = () => {
    setCar(previousState => {
      return { ...previousState, color: "blue" }
    });
  }

  return (
    <>
      <h1>My {car.brand}</h1>
      <p>
        It is a {car.color} {car.model} from {car.year}.
      </p>
      <button
        type="button"
        onClick={updateColor}
      >Blue</button>
    </>
  )
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Car />);


-> Because we need the current value of state, we pass a function into our setCar function. 
-> This function receives the previous value.
-> We then return an object, spreading the previousState and overwriting only the color.



React useEffect Hooks:

-> The useEffect Hook allows you to perform side effects in your components.
-> Some examples of side effects are: fetching data, directly updating the DOM, and timers.

-> useEffect accepts two arguments. 
-> The second argument is optional.

useEffect(<function>, <dependency>)



Let's use a timer as an example.
Example:

Use setTimeout() to count 1 second after initial render:

import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      setCount((count) => count + 1);
    }, 1000);
  });

  return <h1>I've rendered {count} times!</h1>;
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Timer />);



-> But wait!! It keeps counting even though it should only count once!
-> useEffect runs on every render. That means that when the count changes, a render happens, which then triggers another effect.
-> This is not what we want. There are several ways to control when side effects run.
-> We should always include the second parameter which accepts an array. We can optionally pass dependencies to useEffect in this array.


1. No dependency passed:

useEffect(() => {
  //Runs on every render
});



2. An empty array:

useEffect(() => {
  //Runs only on the first render
}, []);



3. Props or state values:

useEffect(() => {
  //Runs on the first render
  //And any time any dependency value changes
}, [prop, state]);




So, to fix this issue, let's only run this effect on the initial render.


Example:

Only run the effect on the initial render:

import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    setTimeout(() => {
      setCount((count) => count + 1);
    }, 1000);
  }, []); // <- add empty brackets here

  return <h1>I've rendered {count} times!</h1>;
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Timer />);




Example:

Here is an example of a useEffect Hook that is dependent on a variable. If the count variable updates, the effect will run again:

import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function Counter() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [calculation, setCalculation] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    setCalculation(() => count * 2);
  }, [count]); // <- add the count variable here

  return (
    <>
      <p>Count: {count}</p>
      <button onClick={() => setCount((c) => c + 1)}>+</button>
      <p>Calculation: {calculation}</p>
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Counter />);




-> If there are multiple dependencies, they should be included in the useEffect dependency array.


Effect Cleanup:
-> Some effects require cleanup to reduce memory leaks.
-> Timeouts, subscriptions, event listeners, and other effects that are no longer needed should be disposed.
-> We do this by including a return function at the end of the useEffect Hook.


Example:

Clean up the timer at the end of the useEffect Hook:

import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function Timer() {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    let timer = setTimeout(() => {
    setCount((count) => count + 1);
  }, 1000);

  return () => clearTimeout(timer)
  }, []);

  return <h1>I've rendered {count} times!</h1>;
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Timer />);





React useContext Hook:


React Context:
-> React Context is a way to manage state globally.
-> It can be used together with the useState Hook to share state between deeply nested components more easily than with useState alone.




The Problem:
-> State should be held by the highest parent component in the stack that requires access to the state.
-> To illustrate, we have many nested components. The component at the top and bottom of the stack need access to the state.
-> To do this without Context, we will need to pass the state as "props" through each nested component. This is called "prop drilling".




Example:

Passing "props" through nested components:

import { useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function Component1() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState("Jesse Hall");

  return (
    <>
      <h1>{`Hello ${user}!`}</h1>
      <Component2 user={user} />
    </>
  );
}

function Component2({ user }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Component 2</h1>
      <Component3 user={user} />
    </>
  );
}

function Component3({ user }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Component 3</h1>
      <Component4 user={user} />
    </>
  );
}

function Component4({ user }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Component 4</h1>
      <Component5 user={user} />
    </>
  );
}

function Component5({ user }) {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Component 5</h1>
      <h2>{`Hello ${user} again!`}</h2>
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Component1 />);

-> Even though components 2-4 did not need the state, they had to pass the state along so that it could reach component 5.




The Solution:

-> The solution is to create context.

Create Context

-> To create context, you must Import createContext and initialize it:

import { useState, createContext } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

const UserContext = createContext()

-> Next we'll use the Context Provider to wrap the tree of components that need the state Context.




Context Provider:

-> Wrap child components in the Context Provider and supply the state value.

function Component1() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState("Jesse Hall");

  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>
      <h1>{`Hello ${user}!`}</h1>
      <Component2 user={user} />
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
}

-> Now, all components in this tree will have access to the user Context.




Use the useContext Hook:
-> In order to use the Context in a child component, we need to access it using the useContext Hook.
-> First, include the useContext in the import statement:

import { useState, createContext, useContext } from "react";

-> Then you can access the user Context in all components:

function Component5() {
  const user = useContext(UserContext);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Component 5</h1>
      <h2>{`Hello ${user} again!`}</h2>
    </>
  );
}





Full Example
Example:

Here is the full example using React Context:

import { useState, createContext, useContext } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

const UserContext = createContext();

function Component1() {
  const [user, setUser] = useState("Jesse Hall");

  return (
    <UserContext.Provider value={user}>
      <h1>{`Hello ${user}!`}</h1>
      <Component2 user={user} />
    </UserContext.Provider>
  );
}

function Component2() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Component 2</h1>
      <Component3 />
    </>
  );
}

function Component3() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Component 3</h1>
      <Component4 />
    </>
  );
}

function Component4() {
  return (
    <>
      <h1>Component 4</h1>
      <Component5 />
    </>
  );
}

function Component5() {
  const user = useContext(UserContext);

  return (
    <>
      <h1>Component 5</h1>
      <h2>{`Hello ${user} again!`}</h2>
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Component1 />);




React useRef Hook:
-> The useRef Hook allows you to persist values between renders.
-> It can be used to store a mutable value that does not cause a re-render when updated.
-> It can be used to access a DOM element directly.


Does Not Cause Re-renders:
-> If we tried to count how many times our application renders using the useState Hook,   
        we would be caught in an infinite loop since this Hook itself causes a re-render.
-> To avoid this, we can use the useRef Hook.




Example:

Use useRef to track application renders.

import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function App() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");
  const count = useRef(0);

  useEffect(() => {
    count.current = count.current + 1;
  });

  return (
    <>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={inputValue}
        onChange={(e) => setInputValue(e.target.value)}
      />
      <h1>Render Count: {count.current}</h1>
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);



-> useRef() only returns one item. It returns an Object called current.
-> When we initialize useRef we set the initial value: useRef(0).
-> It's like doing this: const count = {current: 0}. We can access the count by using count.current.
-> Run this on your computer and try typing in the input to see the application render count increase.




Accessing DOM Elements:
-> In general, we want to let React handle all DOM manipulation.
-> But there are some instances where useRef can be used without causing issues.
-> In React, we can add a ref attribute to an element to access it directly in the DOM.


Example:

Use useRef to focus the input:

import { useRef } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function App() {
  const inputElement = useRef();

  const focusInput = () => {
    inputElement.current.focus();
  };

  return (
    <>
      <input type="text" ref={inputElement} />
      <button onClick={focusInput}>Focus Input</button>
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);




Tracking State Changes:
-> The useRef Hook can also be used to keep track of previous state values.
-> This is because we are able to persist useRef values between renders.


Example:

Use useRef to keep track of previous state values:

import { useState, useEffect, useRef } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function App() {
  const [inputValue, setInputValue] = useState("");
  const previousInputValue = useRef("");

  useEffect(() => {
    previousInputValue.current = inputValue;
  }, [inputValue]);

  return (
    <>
      <input
        type="text"
        value={inputValue}
        onChange={(e) => setInputValue(e.target.value)}
      />
      <h2>Current Value: {inputValue}</h2>
      <h2>Previous Value: {previousInputValue.current}</h2>
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);


-> This time we use a combination of useState, useEffect, and useRef to keep track of the previous state.
-> In the useEffect, we are updating the useRef current value each time the inputValue is updated by entering text into the input field.




React useReducer Hook:

-> The useReducer Hook is similar to the useState Hook.
-> It allows for custom state logic.
-> If you find yourself keeping track of multiple pieces of state that rely on complex logic, useReducer may be useful.


Syntax:

-> The useReducer Hook accepts two arguments.

useReducer(<reducer>, <initialState>)

-> The reducer function contains your custom state logic and the initialStatecan be a simple value but generally will contain an object.
-> The useReducer Hook returns the current stateand a dispatchmethod.



Here is an example of useReducer in a counter app:
Example:

import { useReducer } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

const initialTodos = [
  {
    id: 1,
    title: "Todo 1",
    complete: false,
  },
  {
    id: 2,
    title: "Todo 2",
    complete: false,
  },
];

const reducer = (state, action) => {
  switch (action.type) {
    case "COMPLETE":
      return state.map((todo) => {
        if (todo.id === action.id) {
          return { ...todo, complete: !todo.complete };
        } else {
          return todo;
        }
      });
    default:
      return state;
  }
};

function Todos() {
  const [todos, dispatch] = useReducer(reducer, initialTodos);

  const handleComplete = (todo) => {
    dispatch({ type: "COMPLETE", id: todo.id });
  };

  return (
    <>
      {todos.map((todo) => (
        <div key={todo.id}>
          <label>
            <input
              type="checkbox"
              checked={todo.complete}
              onChange={() => handleComplete(todo)}
            />
            {todo.title}
          </label>
        </div>
      ))}
    </>
  );
}

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Todos />);



-> This is just the logic to keep track of the todo complete status.
-> All of the logic to add, delete, and complete a todo could be contained within a single useReducer Hook by adding more actions.




React useCallback Hook:

-> The React useCallback Hook returns a memoized callback function.
-> Think of memoization as caching a value so that it does not need to be recalculated.
-> This allows us to isolate resource intensive functions so that they will not automatically run on every render.
-> The useCallback Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update.
-> This can improve performance.
-> The useCallback and useMemo Hooks are similar. 
-> The main difference is that useMemo returns a memoized value and useCallback returns a memoized function.




Problem:
-> One reason to use useCallback is to prevent a component from re-rendering unless its props have changed.
-> In this example, you might think that the Todos component will not re-render unless the todos change:
-> This is a similar example to the one in the React.memo section.


Example:

index.js

import { useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import Todos from "./Todos";

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount((c) => c + 1);
  };
  const addTodo = () => {
    setTodos((t) => [...t, "New Todo"]);
  };

  return (
    <>
      <Todos todos={todos} addTodo={addTodo} />
      <hr />
      <div>
        Count: {count}
        <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);



Todos.js

import { memo } from "react";

const Todos = ({ todos, addTodo }) => {
  console.log("child render");
  return (
    <>
      <h2>My Todos</h2>
      {todos.map((todo, index) => {
        return <p key={index}>{todo}</p>;
      })}
      <button onClick={addTodo}>Add Todo</button>
    </>
  );
};

export default memo(Todos);




-> Try running this and click the count increment button.
-> You will notice that the Todos component re-renders even when the todos do not change.
-> Why does this not work? We are using memo, so the Todos component should not re-render since neither the todos state nor 
        the addTodo function are changing when the count is incremented.
-> This is because of something called "referential equality".
-> Every time a component re-renders, its functions get recreated. Because of this, the addTodo function has actually changed.





Solution:

-> To fix this, we can use the useCallback hook to prevent the function from being recreated unless necessary.
-> Use the useCallback Hook to prevent the Todos component from re-rendering needlessly:


Example:

index.js

import { useState, useCallback } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import Todos from "./Todos";

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount((c) => c + 1);
  };
  const addTodo = useCallback(() => {
    setTodos((t) => [...t, "New Todo"]);
  }, [todos]);

  return (
    <>
      <Todos todos={todos} addTodo={addTodo} />
      <hr />
      <div>
        Count: {count}
        <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
      </div>
    </>
  );
};

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);



Todos.js

import { memo } from "react";

const Todos = ({ todos, addTodo }) => {
  console.log("child render");
  return (
    <>
      <h2>My Todos</h2>
      {todos.map((todo, index) => {
        return <p key={index}>{todo}</p>;
      })}
      <button onClick={addTodo}>Add Todo</button>
    </>
  );
};

export default memo(Todos);

-> Now the Todos component will only re-render when the todos prop changes.




React useMemo Hook:

-> The React useMemo Hook returns a memoized value.
-> Think of memoization as caching a value so that it does not need to be recalculated.
-> The useMemo Hook only runs when one of its dependencies update.
-> This can improve performance.
-> The useMemo and useCallback Hooks are similar. 
-> The main difference is that useMemo returns a memoized value and useCallback returns a memoized function. 



Performance:

-> The useMemo Hook can be used to keep expensive, resource intensive functions from needlessly running.

In this example, we have an expensive function that runs on every render.

-> When changing the count or adding a todo, you will notice a delay in execution.


Example:

A poor performing function. The expensiveCalculation function runs on every render:

import { useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);
  const calculation = expensiveCalculation(count);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount((c) => c + 1);
  };
  const addTodo = () => {
    setTodos((t) => [...t, "New Todo"]);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>My Todos</h2>
        {todos.map((todo, index) => {
          return <p key={index}>{todo}</p>;
        })}
        <button onClick={addTodo}>Add Todo</button>
      </div>
      <hr />
      <div>
        Count: {count}
        <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
        <h2>Expensive Calculation</h2>
        {calculation}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

const expensiveCalculation = (num) => {
  console.log("Calculating...");
  for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {
    num += 1;
  }
  return num;
};

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);




Use useMemo:
-> To fix this performance issue, we can use the useMemo Hook to memoize the expensiveCalculation function. 
-> This will cause the function to only run when needed.
-> We can wrap the expensive function call with useMemo.
-> The useMemoHook accepts a second parameter to declare dependencies. 
-> The expensive function will only run when its dependencies have changed.

In the following example, the expensive function will only run when count is changed and not when todo's are added.


Example:

Performance example using the useMemo Hook:

import { useState, useMemo } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

const App = () => {
  const [count, setCount] = useState(0);
  const [todos, setTodos] = useState([]);
  const calculation = useMemo(() => expensiveCalculation(count), [count]);

  const increment = () => {
    setCount((c) => c + 1);
  };
  const addTodo = () => {
    setTodos((t) => [...t, "New Todo"]);
  };

  return (
    <div>
      <div>
        <h2>My Todos</h2>
        {todos.map((todo, index) => {
          return <p key={index}>{todo}</p>;
        })}
        <button onClick={addTodo}>Add Todo</button>
      </div>
      <hr />
      <div>
        Count: {count}
        <button onClick={increment}>+</button>
        <h2>Expensive Calculation</h2>
        {calculation}
      </div>
    </div>
  );
};

const expensiveCalculation = (num) => {
  console.log("Calculating...");
  for (let i = 0; i < 1000000000; i++) {
    num += 1;
  }
  return num;
};

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<App />);




React Custom Hooks:

-> Hooks are reusable functions.
-> When you have component logic that needs to be used by multiple components, we can extract that logic to a custom Hook.
-> Custom Hooks start with "use". 
  Example: useFetch.



Build a Hook:
-> In the following code, we are fetching data in our Home component and displaying it.
-> We will use the JSONPlaceholder service to fetch fake data. This service is great for testing applications when there is no existing data.
-> Use the JSONPlaceholder service to fetch fake "todo" items and display the titles on the page:


Example:

index.js:

import { useState, useEffect } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

const Home = () => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos")
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((data) => setData(data));
 }, []);

  return (
    <>
      {data &&
        data.map((item) => {
          return <p key={item.id}>{item.title}</p>;
        })}
    </>
  );
};

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Home />);


-> The fetch logic may be needed in other components as well, so we will extract that into a custom Hook.
-> Move the fetch logic to a new file to be used as a custom Hook:


Example:

useFetch.js:

import { useState, useEffect } from "react";

const useFetch = (url) => {
  const [data, setData] = useState(null);

  useEffect(() => {
    fetch(url)
      .then((res) => res.json())
      .then((data) => setData(data));
  }, [url]);

  return [data];
};

export default useFetch;



index.js:

import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";
import useFetch from "./useFetch";

const Home = () => {
  const [data] = useFetch("https://jsonplaceholder.typicode.com/todos");

  return (
    <>
      {data &&
        data.map((item) => {
          return <p key={item.id}>{item.title}</p>;
        })}
    </>
  );
};

const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(<Home />);



Example Explained:
-> We have created a new file called useFetch.js containing a function called useFetch which contains all of the logic needed to fetch our data.
-> We removed the hard-coded URL and replaced it with a url variable that can be passed to the custom Hook.
-> Lastly, we are returning our data from our Hook.
-> In index.js, we are importing our useFetch Hook and utilizing it like any other Hook. 
-> This is where we pass in the URL to fetch data from.
-> Now we can reuse this custom Hook in any component to fetch data from any URL.
